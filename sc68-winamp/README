*Synopsis*                                   

  winamp is an old well known media player for Windows platforms.

  This project is an input plugin for winamp 5 to play sc68 compatible
  files. It's available for GNU/autotools and Microsoft Visual Studio.

  Winamp does not natively handle multi-track per file for this reason
  it's not the best player for listening soundchip musics that
  traditionally have more than one music per file. This plugin will
  (or not if disabled) hook the previous/next track commands to jump
  to the previous/next song in the file.


*Important*

  You need to download and extract the winamp SDK.
  MsVC users:
  - Set an environment variable *WASDK* to the location of the SDK.
  - The path to Winamp directory is currently hard-coded which is a
    bother if you don't use a 64bit Windows or did not install winamp
    in the default location (C:\Program Files (x86)\Winamp). You'll
    might need to edit the custom post build step that copy the DLL
    directly into that directory.
  GNU/autotools users:
  - The compilation has been tested using Cygwin32 (should work with
    Cygwin64 too) using i686-w64-mingw32 toolchain. Use the configure options
    --with-winamp-sdk and --with-winamp-dir to setup the locations properly.
  > make winamp
    Install the plugin in the winamp directory (no stripping).
  > make install or install-strip
    Install the plugin traditionally in the specified location
    (--prefix or whatever). this is how the sc68 installer is built.
