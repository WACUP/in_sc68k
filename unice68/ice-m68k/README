The 3 files in this directory are the original ICE sources slightly
modifed.

* ice_unpa.s and ice_unp2.s

  are 2 versions of the ice depacker routine but I have no idea why
  there is 2 of them. Back in tine I always used the first
  version. That is also the one that was used for unice68 depacker.

* ice-pack-235.s

   is the packer routine stripped from everything else. Made PIC and
   reentrant for the occasion and with an entry point (+2) that should
   be compatible with the m68k ABI (so you can call it in "C"). I did
   not really test that part though.
