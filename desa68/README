ABOUT DESA68

  desa68 project is a tiny "C" library to disassemble 68000 code with
  extended support to help building a sourcer.

  * Produce Motorola dialect (syntax).

  * Does not support extended instruction for 68020 or later CPUs.

  * Lower/upper case control.

  * Allow symbolic disassembly (automatic symbol or callback).

  * Extended information on the disassembled instruction allows to use
    the library efficiently for sourcing 68000 code. The sourcer68
    project uses desa68 to that effect.
